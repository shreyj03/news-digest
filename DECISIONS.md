# Decisions

A running log of non-trivial technical decisions for this project: what was chosen, why, and what else was considered.

> Entries below dated 2026-08-26 marked "(backfilled)" were reconstructed from the project plan and setup conversation after the fact, not logged at the moment the call was made.

## 2026-08-26 — Public GitHub repo (backfilled)

**Decision:** Created `news-digest` as a public repo on GitHub, in its own git repository scoped to the project folder.
**Why:** No sensitive data or credentials involved in this project; public was the user's preference. A separate, project-scoped `.git` was used instead of the pre-existing git repo rooted at the home directory, to avoid entangling this project with unrelated home-directory tracking.
**Alternatives considered:**
- Private repo — rejected, no need to restrict visibility for this project
- Reusing the existing home-directory git repo — rejected, that repo tracks the entire home folder and isn't scoped to this project

## 2026-08-26 — Deploy target: Docker on a small VM/PaaS, not serverless (backfilled)

**Decision:** Deploy the web app (API + frontend) as Docker containers on a single small VM or a PaaS like Fly.io/Render.
**Why:** Docker is already a known part of the stack, and the web app's traffic doesn't need Lambda-scale elasticity — it's a small CRUD app plus a read view.
**Alternatives considered:**
- AWS Lambda for the web app itself — rejected as unnecessary complexity/cost for this traffic pattern (Lambda is still used, just for the ingestion job — see scheduler decision below)
- Bare-metal/manual server setup without containers — rejected, Docker keeps deploys reproducible with less extra effort

## 2026-08-26 — Article matching: keyword/TF-IDF first, embeddings later if needed (backfilled)

**Decision:** Match articles to topics using keyword/TF-IDF matching initially, not embeddings.
**Why:** Embeddings solve a precision problem there's no evidence of yet. Building the simple version first and observing real match quality avoids paying for complexity that may not be needed.
**Alternatives considered:**
- Embedding-based semantic matching from day one — rejected for now; revisit only if keyword matching is visibly bad in practice

## 2026-08-26 — Scheduler: node-cron locally, AWS EventBridge + Lambda in production (backfilled)

**Decision:** Use node-cron to run the ingestion job on a schedule during local development, and AWS EventBridge + Lambda for the daily run once deployed.
**Why:** AWS is already familiar tooling, and EventBridge/Lambda is a natural fit for a job that just needs to run once a day with no server to keep alive.
**Alternatives considered:**
- Running node-cron in production inside a long-lived process — rejected, means paying for an always-on process just to fire once a day
- A third-party scheduling SaaS — not considered seriously given existing AWS familiarity

## 2026-08-26 — Database: Postgres (backfilled)

**Decision:** Use Postgres as the datastore for topics, articles, and topic-article matches.
**Why:** Relational structure fits the data model well (topics, articles, and a join table for matches with scores), and Postgres is a safe, well-understood default.
**Alternatives considered:**
- A NoSQL document store — rejected, the data is inherently relational (topics ↔ articles via a join table) and doesn't need schema flexibility
- SQLite — rejected, this app is expected to run as a deployed service, not a single-file local tool

## 2026-08-26 — Backend: Node.js + Express (or Fastify) + TypeScript (backfilled)

**Decision:** Build the API in Node.js/TypeScript using Express (or Fastify).
**Why:** Keeps the stack in one language (TypeScript) across frontend and backend, and Express/Fastify are both simple enough for what's essentially a CRUD API plus one read endpoint.
**Alternatives considered:**
- A different language/framework for the backend (e.g., Python/Django, given prior experience per [[project_stock_tracker]]) — not chosen for this project, to keep the whole stack in one language
- A heavier framework (e.g., NestJS) — rejected, unnecessary structure for the app's size

## 2026-08-26 — Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite, not Next.js (backfilled)

**Decision:** Build the frontend with React, TypeScript, and Vite.
**Why:** The app doesn't need server-side rendering — it's a logged-in-to-yourself dashboard-style app, not something that needs SEO or fast first paint for anonymous visitors.
**Alternatives considered:**
- Next.js — rejected, its main benefits (SSR, routing conventions, API routes) aren't needed here since there's already a separate Express API and no SSR requirement

## 2026-08-26 — Decouple ingestion pipeline from the web app (backfilled)

**Decision:** Split the system into two independent pieces: a scheduled ingestion job (RSS → parse → match → store) and a normal request-response web app (API + frontend) that only ever reads what the ingestion job already stored.
**Why:** If the ingestion job breaks or an RSS feed goes down, the website should still load fine with yesterday's data instead of hanging or erroring. Coupling them would mean a scraping failure becomes a user-facing outage.
**Alternatives considered:**
- Fetching RSS feeds live on each page request — rejected, makes page load latency and reliability dependent on third-party feed uptime
- A single monolithic process handling both scheduling and serving — rejected, harder to reason about failure modes and to scale/deploy independently later
